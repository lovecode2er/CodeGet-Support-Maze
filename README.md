Maze Game

Labyrinth (Greek: lambda alpha beta_rho_theta_, Latin Transliteration: labyrinthos) refers to a complex passageway, which makes it difficult to find the way from its interior to the entrance or from the entrance to the center. The roads are complex and difficult to distinguish, and it is difficult for people to enter and get out of buildings. It usually refers to complex and difficult problems or elusive situations.

Humans have been building mazes for 5000 years. In the different times of the world's cultural development, these strange buildings have always attracted people to struggle along winding and difficult paths to find the truth.

Around 1600 BC, the first maze was built in Mycenae, in a palace of the capital of Crete. It is very similar to the labyrinth painted in clay board in twelfth Century BC found by Pirro in Greece.

During the Trojan War of the 12th century B.C., many peoples invaded Mycenae's Greece, destroyed cities and castles, lost traditions, and the magic of the labyrinth seemed to weaken. However, the neglect of tradition has not reduced people's interest in maze. In the first millennium B.C., this interest expanded from the Mediterranean to Syria and then to the countries of the East - Afghanistan, India, Sri Lanka and Indonesia today. It soon spread to the West: Spain, Britain, Scandinavia and Ross.

In Rome, maze patterns became the first choice for decorations. In the aristocratic mansion, the lobby and dining room are decorated with maze patterns. The center of these geometric patterns is usually a scene in ancient mythology: Theseus and the murdered Minotauros. People at that time seemed to be more concerned about the pattern, sometimes not about their "labyrinth" is wrong - neither in nor out.

In the Christian era, the holy power of the maze came back again. The whole life of man is like a maze, and the center of this labyrinth is the turning point of life. Only through the hard and tortuous pilgrimage road can we say goodbye to the evil life, reach the center of the maze, and find the purpose of life there.

In the small patterns used to decorate manuscripts in the early Middle Ages, the shape of the labyrinth changed. The priest, Ottfried Weisherbergsky, made the lines of the labyrinth pattern form a Christian cross, which resulted in a multifarious Gothic labyrinth. These labyrinth patterns are often used to decorate the entrance to the cathedral. For example, the chapel of Charle is a labyrinth. If you want to enter the center of the church, you should take 28 turns - the same as the days of lunar month.

The maze of popular grass in Medieval England is the way to grow turf into a maze. It's not hard to imagine what kind of design it is. Young people like to come here for a walk; craftsmen's guilds hold festivals here; and citizens often come here for religious celebrations. Up to today, there are still dozens of such labyrinth for tourists to visit. South Welsh has a very old maze preserved. Its construction dates back to 1800.

Europe has entered the Renaissance in the 13~17 century. Germany produced 3 mazes, one called "wheel" in Hannover. Two more were built by Swedish soldiers during the 30-year war (1618-1648), one north of Naumburg, called the Swedish Wheel, and the other in Gretchen, called the Swedish Mower. In Scandinavia, the Baltic Sea and Russia, there are more than 50

A single maze is a labyrinth with only one way to go.

For the single maze, there is a universal solution, that is, walking along a certain wall. While walking, the left (right) hand is always touching the wall on the left (right) side. This method may take the longest time, or it may make you walk through every corner of the maze and every dead road, but the player will never be trapped in it forever.

Our maze game is mainly aimed at developing your memory and intelligence.

Let you gradually challenge the difficulty and enhance the fun of customs clearance.
